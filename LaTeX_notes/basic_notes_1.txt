table
\begin{tabular}{r|cl}
1st column & 2nd column & 3rd column\\
\hline
a & b & c
\end{tabular}

{r|cl} defines the alignment of the columns
r - right
c - centre
l - left
| - indicates that a vertical line should be added between those two columns
& - seperates the columns in the body
\\ - indicates the end of each line of the table
\hline - a horizontal line

-

list
unordered list
\begin{itemize}
\item this is one item
\item this is another itme
\end{itemize}

ordered list
\begin{enumerate}
\item this is one item
\item this is another item
\end{enumerate}

-

\label{labelname}
\ref{labelname}

-

math equations
to enter a math expression in the middle of text - $math expression$
to enter a math expression in its own line and centred - $$math expression$$

to label an equation
\begin{equation}
\label{name}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}
Some text \ref{equation}

to label multiple equations
the equations are aligned along & and each line is terminated by `\\`
\begin{align}
\label{einstein}
E & = mc^2 \\
\label{newton}
F & = ma \\
\label{euler}
e^{i \pi} & = -1
\end{align}

to use align without numbering(if you wouldn't refer them later)
use - \begin{align*}

-

^ - superscript
_ - subscript
{} - to include multiple characters in the super/subscript

-

fraction
$\frac{numerator}{denominator}$

-

binomial coefficient

\pmod{n} - paranthesis
\bdmos{n} - no paranthesis

-

discrete maths
\forall 
\exists

-

inequality
\noeq - not equal
\geq - greater than or equal
\leq - less than or equal

-

\infty - for infinity
\cdot - dot for multiplication
\cup - union
\cap - intersection
\{ - to use {
\} - to use }
\approx - to use the waxy equal symbol

-

if you use [ or ] or any bracket as it is they don't scale according to the content
\left and \right commands. These commands ensure that the parentheses, brackets, or other delimiters automatically scale with the content.
\left( and \right) for parentheses.
\left[ and \right] for square brackets.
\left\{ and \right\} for curly braces.
\left| and \right| for absolute value bars.

-

texts in equations are very wierd so
\text{text to write} in the middle of an equation

-

matrices
\begin{array}{clr}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{array}

to add brackets around this matrix, use the \left and \right conecpt
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\right)

-

for summation and prod use \sum and \prod
$$\sum_(i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} = 1$$

-

to create a macro
\newcommand{\commandname}{definition} - replaces \commandname with definition
to overwrite commands - \renewcommand{\commandname}{definition}
